                <p>Anwar El-Sadat was the third President of Egypt, serving from 1970 until his assassination in 1981. A visionary leader and skilled strategist, Sadat is most remembered for his bold and decisive leadership during the October War of 1973. Under his command, the Egyptian Armed Forces launched a surprise attack that successfully crossed the Suez Canal and dealt a major blow to the occupying Israeli forces, restoring Arab pride and military dignity.</p>
